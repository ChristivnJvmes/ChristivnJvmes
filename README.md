### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Christian Wilson and I am a learning developer

I am currently finishing college and working as a Sr. Technician at Core Logic | a la mode

Alongside work and school I am completing full-stack engineer and iOS development courses through Codecademy
in hopes of landing my first developer job very soon!

My focus is on iOS app development (swiftUI) but I am learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and other full-stack/web development skills as well.
